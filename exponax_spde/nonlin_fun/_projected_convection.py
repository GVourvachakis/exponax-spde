        Performs a pseudo-spectral evaluation of the nonlinear convection term
        for the 3d incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in velocity
        formulation using the rotational form. In state space, it reads

        ```
            𝒩(u) = 𝒫(u × ω)
        ```

        with `u` the velocity, `ω = ∇ × u` the vorticity, and `𝒫` the Leray
        projection onto divergence-free fields.

        The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations read

        ```
            uₜ = -(u ⋅ ∇)u - ∇p + ν Δu
        ```

        The [Lamb vector identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_vector)
        allows rewriting the convection term as

        ```
            (u ⋅ ∇)u = ∇(|u|²/2) + ω × u
        ```

        Substituting and rearranging gives

        ```
            uₜ = u × ω - ∇(|u|²/2 + p) + ν Δu
        ```

        where `u × ω = -(ω × u)`. The Leray projection `𝒫` projects onto the
        space of divergence-free fields by removing any gradient component
        (i.e., `𝒫(∇φ) = 0` for any scalar `φ`). Since both the pressure
        gradient `∇p` and the kinetic energy gradient `∇(|u|²/2)` are
        gradients of scalar fields, the projection annihilates them:

        ```
            𝒫(uₜ) = 𝒫(u × ω) + ν Δu
        ```

        Hence, the nonlinear term reduces to `𝒩(u) = 𝒫(u × ω)`, and the
        pressure never needs to be computed explicitly.

        The curl is computed in Fourier space, the cross product `u × ω` in
        physical space (pseudo-spectral), and the result is projected back
        in Fourier space.

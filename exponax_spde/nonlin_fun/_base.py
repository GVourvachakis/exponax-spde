        Base class for all nonlinear functions. This class provides the basic
        functionality to dealias the nonlinear terms and perform forward and
        inverse Fourier transforms.

        **Arguments:**

        - `num_spatial_dims`: The number of spatial dimensions `D`.
        - `num_points`: The number of points `N` used to discretize the domain.
            This **includes** the left boundary point and **excludes** the right
            boundary point. In higher dimensions; the number of points in each
            dimension is the same.
        - `dealiasing_fraction`: The fraction of the highest resolved mode to
            keep for dealiasing. For example, `2/3` corresponds to Orszag's 2/3
            rule typically used for quadratic nonlinearities. If `None`, no
            dealiasing is performed.

        !!! info
            Dealiasing is applied both before and after the nonlinear
            evaluation: the `ifft` method zeros out high modes before
            transforming to physical space (pre-dealiasing), and the `fft`
            method zeros out high modes after transforming back to Fourier
            space (post-dealiasing). Pre-dealiasing ensures that the
            physical-space representation is free of aliased modes before
            computing nonlinear products. Post-dealiasing removes any aliases
            created by those products, so that the returned nonlinear term is
            spectrally clean.

        !!! info
            Some dealiasing strategies (like Orszag's 2/3 rule) are designed to
            not fully remove aliasing (which would require 1/2 in the case of
            quadratic nonlinearities), rather to only have aliases being created
            in those modes that will be zeroed out anyway. See also [Orszag
            (1971)](https://doi.org/10.1175/1520-0469(1971)028%3C1074:OTEOAI%3E2.0.CO;2)
